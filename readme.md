# Calcflow
The repository contains the open-sourced code to Calcflow. Calcflow is a powerful mathematical visualization tool that is designed to give students, educators, and engineers alike a better grasp on some of the most difficult concepts in vector calculus. Utilizing the best UI/UX theory, Calcflow is an intuitive VR interface for vector calculus and is used by scientists and engineers for both educational and commercial applications. Some of the core features are as follows:

* Parametric graphing utility designed to map points in 2D space into 3D by defining (x,y,z) as a function of parameters u and v. Recent functionality also includes the ability to map from 1D to 3D.
* Vector field utility
* Cross product and vector addition modules rendered in real time as a user moves the initial vectors around
* Double integral grapher
